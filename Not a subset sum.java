Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 45.92%Submissions: 25K+Points: 4
Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers, find the smallest positive integer such that it cannot be represented as the sum of elements of any subset of the given array set.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 7.
Input: arr[] = [3, 6, 9, 10, 20, 28]
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the smallest positive number for which no subset is there with sum 1.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
1 <= arr[i] <= 108

        long sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
           if(arr[i]>sum+1){
               return sum+1;
           }
           sum+=arr[i];
